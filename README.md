# Facial-Attendance
The facial recognition attendance system identifies individuals and records their attendance in an Excel spreadsheet. Additionally, it sends an email to parents containing information about their child's attendance using UIpath.


PS: forgot to add the XAML file for UIpath Automation, will be adding it soon
